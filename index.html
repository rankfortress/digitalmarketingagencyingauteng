	Brand recognition is turning into a major criterion of the digital marketing and promotion area. Since significance will in general support huge names, and links from top-ranking sites, specialty indexes, and definitive sources are critical to ascending through the search rankings. When we build a brand-new website, our number one priority is to get as many backlinks as possible. These are the free passes to the coveted first position in the organic results. But we don’t stop there. We continue to build out your link profile with quality backlinks from sites that are relevant to your business. As your site gains authority, you can start to let go of the lower quality backlinks until they become less and less important. And, just because a backlink is ‘free’ doesn’t mean it’s not valuable. We offer enough work to become an authority in the field that it will be impossible for any potential employer to ignore you.
